## Hi there 👋
I’m Sumati Johri, a B.Tech CSE student (’29) who loves turning ideas into code 💻✨. I explore Machine Learning by building data-driven models and enjoy crafting clean, responsive web experiences 🌐. Curious by nature, I learn best by experimenting, building, and improving one project at a time 🤖📊.
